# ECS34Project1
ECS34 Project 1 HW; mostly dealing with strings

Student 1: Surinder Bath (919433946)

## Project Status
Currently working on Center and Ljust functions.

# Known Issues
Split and probably Join ", "
    ->if splt parameter is empty string, then split on white space
Check over center and make sure it's doing what it's supposed to
